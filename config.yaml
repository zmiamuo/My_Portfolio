    content: |-
      I recently graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Applied Mathematics, and as the next step I want to pursue a Master’s Degree in the Data Science and Machine Learning field. I strongly believe that Machine Learning is the future, as it can be used to solve many of the complex problems we face in our daily life.
      
      I am currently taking the Data Science and Machine Learning courses from DataCamp to sharpen my skills and be better equipped for the upcoming challenges.

                Created a model based on Random Forest algorithm, that predicted the probability of a customer churning in the future. 
                Thanks to this predictive model, we optimized the company strategy of giving the 20% discounts to only 
                potential churning customers.
